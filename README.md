> **Abstract**: What factors shape public opinion on nuclear proliferation? Using survey experiments fielded to nationally representative samples in a non-nuclear weapon state, we show that individual propensity to support nuclear proliferation is a function of personal assessments of the external threat environment moderated by personal values. Processes at the level of the international system therefore interact with values located at the level of the individual in producing public attitudes towards nuclear proliferation. We find that not all values are equal: those conditioning personal propensity to support acquisition more intensely are those that privilege personal and group safety via social stability, family security, social order, and harmony.
